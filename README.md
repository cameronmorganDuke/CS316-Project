**Current Features and Completed Milestones**

**Improved Search and Display for All Addresses**

JP led the refinement of the search functionality within our address table, ensuring that users can now easily search for properties and navigate across pages. This enhancement makes it easier for users to find specific properties in the database without being limited by the page indexing. His work has set the foundation for future expansion, such as linking addresses to more detailed property information.

**Property Rating System with Adjustable Sliders**

Marcus introduced a rating feature for each property, allowing users to rate homes based on various criteria. Additionally, he developed adjustable sliders that empower users to modify property attributes, enabling more dynamic analysis. This feature enhances user engagement and enables a personalized property assessment experience, providing users with the ability to evaluate properties on customized metrics that align with their investment strategies.

**Similar Home Query Based on Neighborhood and Bedrooms**

Cameron and Connor collaborated to implement a similar home search feature. By querying the database for homes with the same number of bedrooms in the same neighborhood, they created a tool that provides users with comparable property options. This feature is particularly useful for investors looking to compare potential investments within specific regions, thereby enhancing their decision-making process through a more localized analysis.
